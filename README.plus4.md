# Penetrator for the Commodore Plus 4

I was recently asked to help someone port my implementation of Penetrator to their homebrew 6502.  Since I haven't looked at the code in a few years, and just got an actual Commodore Plus4, I decided it might be a good idea to do a port to the Plus4 to familiarize myself with the code, again.  
  
The port took me quite a bit longer than I had expected.  Mostly getting the keyboard and joystick working the way I wanted.  Of course, the audio also had to be done - I started this version from the Apple 2 port, not the Commander X16 port.  The Apple 2 port at least had Audio.  
  
All in all, I am quite happy with the Plus4 version.  It was fun to learn some new things about the Plus4.
