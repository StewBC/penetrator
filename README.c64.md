# Penetrator for the Commodore 64  
  
This version of Penetrator was almost "for free" once I made the Plus4 version of the game.  
  
I had some trouble coming to grips with doing audio on the C64 and even though I managed it technically, it will be clear that doing audio is not my forte.  I guess this is passable, but not great.  
  
The joystick, if used, goes in Port 2.  I made this version, just like the Plus4 version, bomb and shoot both on the one Joystick button.  I also made the key to the right of p, or the key to the left of q be the fire button (hopefully works for both left- and right-handed people).  The ZX Spectrum game used the forward button also as the shoot button (short press vs hold).  That made the game way harder to play but since I am now old with slow reflexes, I need all the help I can get.
